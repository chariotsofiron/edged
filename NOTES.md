# Adjacency list

- Easy to associate with weights / other metadata efficiently
- Append only


# Adjacency matrix


- More efficient / elegant for a handful of algorithms, get to use linear algebra
- Difficult to associate nodes/edges with data
- Iterating edges can be O(n_edges) using trailing zero intrinsics
- Can be modified
- Adding new nodes can be slow... (can be amortized)
